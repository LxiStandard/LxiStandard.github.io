At the June 2023 LXI meeting the LXI Consortium decided to create a
public LXI subdomain with various elements that LXI
needs to have publicly available.  That includes specifications
and the XML schema files for the LXI API.

This repository is (will be) that subdomain.  It contains 
complete sets of LXI specifications that devices comply with 
that implement various LXI extended functions.
