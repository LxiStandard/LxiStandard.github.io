See the previous post about an updated version of the LXI API Extended Function dated Feb 10, 2025.
The API Extended Function specification was wrongly updated from 1.1 (editorial) to 1.2. This notification is announcing that the version has gone back to 1.1 Editorial March 10, 2025.
<!--excerpt-->

The only change to this version of the API Extended Function are:
   - To change the version back to v1.1
   - Add a Rule to the LXIVersion element that all LXI Devices are required to have the now optional LXIVersion unless  they are a Connected Device that is not a LXI Device.
