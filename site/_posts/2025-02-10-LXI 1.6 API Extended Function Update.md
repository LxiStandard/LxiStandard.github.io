A new updated version of the LXI API Extended Function has been posted. API Extended Function v1.1 has been replaced with v1.2
<!--excerpt-->

In LXI 1.6 testing it was determined that the Indentification schema, defined in the API Extended Function is not backward compatible.

THe issue is that in V1.0 of this schema a Connected Device inherits from Device. In making this schema more swaggable a Connected device
in V2.0 inherits from  a LXIDevice. The problem is that a LXIDevice has a required element called LXIVersion.
Not all Connected Devices might be LXI Devices so requiring this element is wrong. The easy solution is to make the LXIVersion element in
the LXIDevice optional. This still does not fix the backward compatibility issue between v1.0 and v2.0.

THis is the only change but it was deemed more than an editorial change so the version of the LXI API Extended Function has been bumped
from v1.1 to v1.2

This should be of no concern to LXI vendors except those that have Connected Devices defined in their XML Indentification schema.
