# LXI Specification Downloads

LXI defines a series of specifications.  The primary specification
is the LXI Device specification.  The version of the LXI Device
specification is the LXI version.  There are additional LXI specifications, 
known as *extended functions* that define how various optional 
capabilities must be implemented in conformant devices (for
instance IPv6).  

When the LXI Device specification is updated, the extended functions
may or may not be updated.  Therefore, the extended functions
have revision numbers and dates independent of the LXI 
Device Specification version and date.  

The LXI Device Specification
establishes the versions of extended functions that a conformant
device must conform to in order to conform to that LXI version.

The sections below this page contain the complete set of specifications and 
ancillary documents for specific LXI versions.
