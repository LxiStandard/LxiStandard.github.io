# LXI API Schemas

LXI defines a REST HTTP API that utilizes XSD schemas to 
define the parameters for the REST operations. This page 
contains references to the most current, and historical 
versions of those schemas.

For details on the APIs, the schemas, and their use, see 
the LXI API Extended Function here.

The schemas are in XSD format and do not return formatted HTML pages.

The schemas are maintained in the LXI github source 
repository. For access contact the LXI consortium.
