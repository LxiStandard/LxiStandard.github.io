# LXI Instrument Identification Schema

The LXI Identification schema represents LXI device 
identity information, and identity information for 
devices that are connected to an LXI device.

The current version is 2.0.

Note that the documentation below for the 1.0 version of the
schema is inaccurate since the schema itself is based on an 
earlier style. Documentation can be found in versions of  the
LXI Specifications <em>before</em> LXI 1.6.1.

The following examples are provided:

| Example | Purpose |
| ------------- |-------------|
| InstrumentWithSubinstrumentsExample.xml | Simple example showing a device with some subinstruments |
