# Draft LXI 1.6 Specifications

This is the DRAFT LXI 1.6 version of  the specifications. For information
on how LXI documents are organized see:

   [LXI Specifications](https://public.lxistandard.org/specifications.html)
   
LXI 1.6 adds network security features, and an LXI REST API which is
used to manage the device security settings.  The LXI REST API
may also be extended for other applications in future LXI versions.

LXI 1.6 also has various editorial updates, including an update
to the LXI identification schema.  This new schema is in a simplified
XSD style, but validates all known LXI Identification XML files 
that were based on the previous schema.

For additional details on differences, see the Guide to the LXI 
Documentation and revision tables in the individual specifications.
