# LXI 1.6 Specifications

This is the LXI 1.6 version of  the specifications.

LXI 1.6 adds network security features, and an LXI REST API which is
used to manage the device security settings.  The LXI REST API
may also be extended for other applications in future LXI versions.

LXI 1.6 also has various editorial udpates, including an update
to the LXI identification schema.  This new schema is in a simplified
XSD style, but validates all known LXI Identification XML files 
based on the previous schema.

For additional details on differences, see the Guide to the LXI 
Documentation and revision tables in the individual specifications.

LXI 1.6 was passed in 2023 and is the most current version of the
LXI Specifications.
